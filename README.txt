# Borkle Games
This is a django based web app that hosts some games I have built for fun.
The games use Javascript to allow asnycronous play with one more players.

Figuring out how to sync multiple players to create a smooth game play experience
was an opportunity to beef up my Javascript and front end skills. The mental challenge
of how to organize games, game players, turns, and rules into a database model was
an exceptionally fun puzzle to solve.

# Usage
Feel free to clone and run the games locally, but it's a lot more fun with friends.

Have fun!
